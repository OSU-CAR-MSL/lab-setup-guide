# WSL2 Setup

This guide walks you through installing and configuring the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), the foundation for local development in the lab.

## Why WSL2

Most development tools in the lab ecosystem -- SSH, Python toolchains, Git, `uv`, and terminal-based utilities -- are designed for Linux. WSL2 lets you run a full Linux environment directly on your Windows machine without dual-booting or a virtual machine.

Key points:

- **Real Linux kernel.** WSL2 ships a lightweight Linux kernel managed by Windows, so you get native syscall compatibility. Tools like `ssh-keygen`, `rsync`, and shell scripts work exactly as they would on a Linux server.
- **VS Code integration.** VS Code's WSL extension connects seamlessly to your Linux filesystem, giving you a native editor experience with Linux tooling underneath.
- **Required for lab workflows.** The [Python Environment Setup](python-environment-setup.md) guide assumes a Linux shell, and SSH connections to OSC are simplest from a Linux terminal.

!!! note "macOS users"
    macOS is Unix-based and does not need WSL. If you are on macOS, skip this page and go directly to [VS Code Setup](vscode-setup.md).

## Installation

=== "Windows 11"

    Windows 11 includes WSL2 support out of the box. A single command handles everything:

    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

    This command:

    1. Enables the "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Subsystem for Linux" features
    2. Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel
    3. Sets WSL2 as the default version
    4. Installs **Ubuntu** as the default distribution

    After the command completes, **restart your computer** when prompted.

    !!! tip "Run as Administrator"
        Open **Windows Terminal** or **PowerShell** as Administrator (right-click, "Run as administrator") before running `wsl --install`.

=== "Windows 10"

    Windows 10 (version 1903+ with Build 18362+) supports WSL2, but requires manual feature enablement.

    **Step 1 -- Enable WSL and Virtual Machine Platform:**

    Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    # Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

    # Enable Virtual Machine Platform (required for WSL2)
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```

    **Restart your computer** after both commands complete.

    **Step 2 -- Install the WSL2 Linux kernel update:**

    Download and run the kernel update package from Microsoft:

    [WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)

    **Step 3 -- Set WSL2 as default:**

    ```powershell
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

    **Step 4 -- Install Ubuntu:**

    Open the **Microsoft Store**, search for **Ubuntu**, and click **Install**. The latest LTS release (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04) is recommended.

    After installation, launch Ubuntu from the Start menu to complete first-time setup.

    !!! warning "Check your Windows version"
        Run `winver` to verify your build number. If you are on an older build that does not support WSL2, update Windows first via Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.

---

## Initial Configuration

When Ubuntu launches for the first time, it prompts you to create a Linux user account. This is separate from your Windows account.

1. **Set a username** -- use something short and lowercase (e.g., your OSU name.N):

    ```
    Enter new UNIX username: buckeye42
    ```

2. **Set a password** -- you will need this for `sudo` commands. It does not display as you type.

3. **Update system packages:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

    Run this periodically (every few weeks) to keep your system packages current.

4. **Verify WSL2 is active:**

    Open a new PowerShell or Windows Terminal window (not inside WSL) and run:

    ```powershell
    wsl -l -v
    ```

    You should see output like:

    ```
      NAME      STATE           VERSION
    * Ubuntu    Running         2
    ```

    The `VERSION` column must show `2`. If it shows `1`, convert it:

    ```powershell
    wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
    ```

## Filesystem Guidance

This is one of the most important performance decisions for your WSL setup.

!!! danger "Do NOT keep code on `/mnt/c/`"
    The `/mnt/c/` mount gives WSL access to your Windows `C:\` drive, but it goes through a **9P protocol translation layer** that is dramatically slower than native Linux I/O. File operations (Git, Python imports, `pip install`, build tools) can be **5-10x slower** on `/mnt/c/` compared to the WSL native filesystem.

**Store all code on the WSL native filesystem:**

```bash
# Create a projects directory in your WSL home
mkdir -p ~/projects

# Clone repos here
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

Your WSL home directory (`~/`) lives on an ext4 virtual disk managed by WSL. It is fast, supports Linux permissions correctly, and avoids the line-ending and permission issues that plague `/mnt/c/`.

| Location | Path example | Speed | Use for |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| WSL native | `~/projects/my-repo` | Fast | All code, venvs, builds |
| Windows mount | `/mnt/c/Users/You/Documents/` | Slow (9P) | Accessing Windows-only files when needed |

!!! tip "Accessing WSL files from Windows"
    You can browse your WSL filesystem from Windows Explorer at `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\your-username\`. This is useful for dragging files into Windows applications, but do your actual development work from within WSL.

For detailed instructions on setting up Python, `uv`, and project virtual environments on the WSL native filesystem, see the [Python Environment Setup](python-environment-setup.md) guide.

## Windows Terminal / WezTerm

You need a good terminal emulator to work comfortably in WSL. Two solid options:

### Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal is Microsoft's modern terminal with tabs, split panes, and GPU-accelerated rendering.

=== "Windows 11"

    Windows Terminal is **pre-installed** on Windows 11. Open it from the Start menu or press ++win+x++ and select "Terminal."

=== "Windows 10"

    Install from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal). Search for **Windows Terminal** and click Install.

After installation, Windows Terminal automatically detects your WSL distributions and adds them as profile options. Click the dropdown arrow next to the tab bar to open a new Ubuntu tab.

**Recommended settings** (open with ++ctrl+comma++):

- Set **Ubuntu** as the default profile so new tabs open in WSL
- Set the starting directory to your WSL home: `//wsl$/Ubuntu/home/your-username`
- Enable "Automatically copy selection to clipboard"

### WezTerm

[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) is a cross-platform terminal written in Rust with built-in multiplexing (similar to tmux), ligature support, and Lua-based configuration.

Download the installer from [wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html).

WezTerm can launch WSL directly. Add this to your `~/.wezterm.lua` config:

```lua
local wezterm = require("wezterm")
local config = wezterm.config_builder()

config.default_domain = "WSL:Ubuntu"
config.font_size = 11.0
config.color_scheme = "Catppuccin Mocha"

return config
```

!!! tip "Why WezTerm?"
    WezTerm's built-in multiplexer means you can split panes and create tabs without needing tmux. This is especially handy if you want `mkdocs serve` running in one pane and your shell in another. It also works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux if you use multiple machines.

## VS Code Integration

VS Code connects to WSL through the **WSL extension**, giving you a full Linux development experience with a native Windows editor.

### Setup

1. **Install the WSL extension** in VS Code:
    - Open VS Code
    - Go to Extensions (++ctrl+shift+x++)
    - Search for `ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl` and install it

    Or from the terminal:

    ```bash
    code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
    ```

2. **Open a WSL folder** from your WSL terminal:

    ```bash
    code ~/projects/my-repo
    ```

    The first time you do this, VS Code downloads and installs its server component inside WSL. This takes a minute but only happens once.

3. **Verify the connection** -- look at the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window. It should show:

    ```
    WSL: Ubuntu
    ```

    This confirms VS Code is running against the WSL filesystem, not the Windows filesystem.

!!! warning "Always open from WSL, not Windows"
    Opening a `/mnt/c/` path from Windows Explorer ("Open with Code") connects VS Code to the Windows filesystem, bypassing WSL. Always open projects from the WSL terminal with `code ~/projects/...` to get the full WSL integration.

### How It Works

When connected to WSL, VS Code runs two components:

- **UI (Windows):** The editor window, menus, and theme rendering
- **Server (WSL):** File access, terminal, extensions, and language servers

This means extensions like Python, Pylance, and Ruff run inside WSL where they have native access to your Linux filesystem and tools. The integrated terminal (++ctrl+grave++) opens a proper WSL shell.

For more on VS Code configuration, extensions, and keyboard shortcuts, see the [VS Code Setup](vscode-setup.md) guide.
