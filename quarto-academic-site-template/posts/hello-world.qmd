## Welcome

This is a sample blog post. Replace it with your own content!

You can write **Markdown**, include `code`, and even embed executable code blocks:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
print("Hello from Python!")
```

## Why Quarto?

Quarto lets you write once and publish to multiple formats — websites, PDFs, slides, and more — all from the same Markdown source.
