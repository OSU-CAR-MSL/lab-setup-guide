# Assignments

Welcome to the lab assignments section. These hands-on assignments are designed to get new undergraduates up to speed with the tools and workflows used in the CAR Mobility Systems Lab.

## How Assignments Work

1. **Read the full assignment** before starting — each one lists prerequisites, estimated time, and deliverables.
2. **Work through the tasks in order** — later tasks build on earlier ones.
3. **Ask for help early** — if you're stuck for more than 15 minutes on a setup issue, post in the lab Slack/Teams channel. Setup problems are normal and everyone encounters them.
4. **Submit your deliverables** as described at the end of each assignment.
